# Master Scanner
Application to scan for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, BLE devices and display their RSSI value and corresponding calculated distance

Wi-Fi

The app can be used to either scan all Wi-Fi signals or a selected individual signal. For quick scan just hit the scan button and all Wi-Fi signals will be listed, if you wish to test just a single signal enter its broadcast name in the search box.

Bluetooth

The app uses BLE standard so you can scan for all devices. For testing purposes also the app can be placed on a second device and used as a peripheral device.
You can toggle between peripheral and scanner. Working the same as Wi-Fi the app can be used to scan all signals or an individual by entering the name of the broadcast name.
